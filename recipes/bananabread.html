    <h1>Banana Bread Recipe</h1>
    <p>This is my own recipe that I learned from my mom!</p>
    <p>It's fluffy, moist, and full of flavor.</p>
    <p>
      It's open to any modifications such as nuts and chocolate chips which can
      just me mixed into the batter! (Once again, this isn't my picture)

      <li>If the butter wasn't salted, add the salt.</li>

          To check if its ready, stick a knife through parts of the bread and if
          it comes out clean, it's done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check the center and sides for readiness throughout all of the bread.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Let it cool for 5-10 minutes and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
