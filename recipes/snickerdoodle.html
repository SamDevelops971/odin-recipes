    <h1>Snickerdoodle Recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe I have been trying to perfect and even now it is nowhere near where I want them to be. </p>
    <p>I started off with an online recipe then slowly began tweaking it to my liking.</p>
    <p>However, they are fluffy, delicious, and a great sweet treat to bring to any event!</p>
    <p>P.S This is not my picture, but this recipe will look 10x better than this one.</p>

     <ol>

        <h3>Cookie Dough</h3>
        <p>I recommend preheating oven to 350 before starting!</p>
        <li>Melt a Stick, or half a cup, of butter.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I recommened browning butter. (Cook on stove 
                    for a few minutes until butter browns. Let it cool for 
                    a few minutes as well.)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Mix melted butter w/ half a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Add however much vanilla extract you want. <strong>No more than 3 caps</strong>.</li>
            <li>Mix in one egg.</li>
            <li>Mix in 3 cups of flour. Mix one cup before moving onto the next and stop if the texture is smooth, but not too doughey.</li>
            <li>Mix in a pinch of salt. (I do not recommend if salted butter is used)</li>
            <li>Mix in 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar</li>
            <li>Mix in 3 teaspoons of baking soda.</li>
            <h3>Cinnamon sugar</h3>
     <ul>
        <li><p>In a separate bowl, mix a quarter cup of granulated sugar w/ an eigth cup cinnamon.</p></li>
     </ul>
        <li>Once cinnamon sugar is made, form the dough into balls and roll them in the cinnamon sugar</li>
        <li>If not done already, set the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Lastly, place on a baking pan and bake for 11-13 minutes until slightly brown and expanded.
        <ul>
            <li><p>I recommend either buttering or lightly spraying the pan w/ oil.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Let them cool after removing them from the oven, and enjoy!</li>
        </li>
     </ol>
